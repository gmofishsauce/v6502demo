		<!-- start content -->
<p>There are a number of test suites for 6502, each with their own intentions and peculiarities. (Instead of using a dedicated test suite, it can also be useful to run a monitor or BASIC interpreter, although the test coverage isn't very high and the run time is.  Favourites are: Apple 1 monitor, Apple 1 integer BASIC, C64 BASIC, BBC OS and BASIC.)
</p><p>For the most part these test programs aim to test emulators, which are subject to different bugs than CPU implementations, and therefore the effective coverage may not be as good as expected.  Such tests are generally self-checking - there is no golden results file of bus activity - and generally assume some specific platform's I/O facilities.
