<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Overview"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>To help explain which state each of our projects is at, here's a description of the steps we follow:
</p>
<ul><li> Get a chip, usually just one of a particular kind but sometimes more
</li><li> Depackage the chip
<ul><li> Chips with a metal lid or a ceramic sandwich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071453/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package" class="external text" rel="nofollow">package</a> are preferable since these have no plastic in contact with the die.
</li><li> Chips packaged in plastic must be treated with very hot, very nasty acids which we do at a local laboratory with proper equipment
</li></ul>
</li><li> Photograph the exposed surface of the chip through a microscope
<ul><li> Many separate photographs must be taken to cover the surface at high enough resolution
</li></ul>
</li><li> Stitch the photographs into a single large image
<ul><li> Alignment data is used to correct individual photographs for optical distortions
</li></ul>
</li><li> Usually, de-layer the chip to reveal hidden or obscured lower features
</li><li> Photograph and stitch each layer image
</li><li> Align all layer images to each other
</li><li> Create polygon models of each part of the chip based on the aligned images
</li><li> Convert the polygon data into a description we can simulate
</li><li> Investigate the behaviour of the chip by simulation
</li><li> Investigate the layout and logic design
</li><li> Write up our results on this wiki
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Microphotography"> Microphotography </span></h2>
<p>Based on our own work and advice from several professionals in the field
</p>
<ul><li> A 20x objective is great, while 100x is overkill and difficult to work with
<ul><li> 10x is sometimes adequate for chips with 4 um to 6 um feature sizes, but its better to shoot at higher magnification and downsample the result.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Useful whole-chip images are typically 6000 to 10000 pixels on a side
</li><li> Use an X-Y table to ensure no rotation between the successive images
<ul><li> A position readout is not needed, and position information from the microscope is not used to stitch images
</li></ul>
</li><li> Try to get the chip dead level so its entire surface is in the focal plane
<ul><li> A tip-tilt stage with micrometer drive is essential for this, unless you are very patient
</li></ul>
</li><li> Use a manual fixed exposure, zoom, and white balance for all images
<ul><li> Microscopes with a variable zoom are not helpful and could waste a lot of your time later on
</li></ul>
</li><li> Save images in RAW format if possible at the highest quality
</li><li> Aim for at least 200 pixels of overlap between adjacent images
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="De-layering"> De-layering </span></h2>
<p>Stripping away individual layers of a chip to reveal the parts and features below can be one of the most difficult and even hazardous procedures owing to the chemicals involved and their byproducts.
</p>
<ul><li> Some labs may use repeated mechanical or chemical-mechanical polishing and photography to image successive layers
<ul><li> This is more common for modern devices, especially those that have been planarized during manufacture
</li><li> It may be riskier and costlier for the older chips we study which have only a single metal layer and whos surfaces are very irregular
</li></ul>
</li><li> Plasma etching and various chemicals can be used to remove all the material of a particular layer at once
</li></ul>
