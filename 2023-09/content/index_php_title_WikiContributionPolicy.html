<title>WikiContributionPolicy - VisualChips</title>
</head>
<body>
		<!-- start content -->
<p>This is the wiki of the VisualChips project, and these are the policies agreed by the administration team.
</p><p>Please respect our wishes to maintain the value of this wiki, by following these policies.
</p>
<ul><li> Account creation is presently disabled because of trouble with spammers
<ul><li> To get an account, please mail us using the address found on the donations page of visual6502.org or send a PM to BigEd on the 6502.org forum
</li><li> Please give us some details of your interest, your previous projects and your intended contribution
</li><li> We'll also need to know what username you'd like
</li></ul>
</li><li> Please maintain a user page with at least a minimal sketch of your background or interests
</li><li> We welcome constructive contributions, such as
<ul><li> Adding information to an existing page
</li><li> Adding links inline or to a Resources section
</li><li> Adding section headers to a long page
</li><li> Adding an explanatory paragraph ahead of a list
</li><li> Fixing spelling or punctuation
</li></ul>
</li><li> Please open a discussion on a talk page before embarking on major work, such as:
<ul><li> Changing any statements of fact
</li><li> Renaming pages
</li><li> Reworking section structure on a page
</li><li> Adding a page or moving content from one page to another
</li><li> Any series of related edits which would be tedious to revert
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>This is how we view the wiki:
</p>
<ul><li> We prefer larger pages rather than many very small ones - multi-screen pages are fine
</li><li> Multi-screen pages should have sections
</li><li> The wiki is the public face of our project
<ul><li> we want our positive progress and our successes to be easy to find
<ul><li> our most active and well known projects should feature on the front page
</li></ul>
</li><li> we want to minimise stubs and missing pages
</li><li> we don't need to collect long to-do lists or wish lists
</li></ul>
</li><li> We do not aim to be encyclopaedic - we should link to existing well-maintained resources like wikipedia or other archaeology sites rather than re-presenting material found elsewhere
</li><li> The majority of the content should be our factual findings, and our progress.
<ul><li> Also explanations, if we have good ones not found elsewhere, and if they arise from our reverse engineering.
</li><li> Anything which can be migrated out to Wikipedia and accepted there need not be kept here.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Page names should have meaningful prefixes so the <a href="/web/20210405071344/http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:AllPages" title="Special:AllPages">alphabetic index</a> makes sense
</li><li> Pages should not consist of an unadorned list - there should be an orientation paragraph and optionally a sentence for each sub page.
<ul><li>  For example, we might have a list of pages one for each chip in progress, and that list can be decorated with a brief statement of the state of play. (Even though that is a minor duplication of information.)
</li></ul>
</li><li> Most pages should have a Resources section with external links - we don't need citations everywhere, but we do want to be part of a larger web.
</li></ul>
