<p>The Visual6502 Project began with a desire to inspire and educate people about the wonders hidden deep inside their computers.  Our online museum and interactive visualization technology have allowed us and the greater public to preserve, study, and collaborate to discover many exciting things about early computer technology.  We're very eager to develop better educational material and to collaborate with various institutions and groups toward this end.  
</p><p>Here are some general resources we've found:
