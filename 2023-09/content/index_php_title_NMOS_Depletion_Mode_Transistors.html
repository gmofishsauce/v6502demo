<title>NMOS Depletion Mode Transistors - VisualChips</title>
</head>
<body>
		<!-- start content -->
<p>The usual circuit design of a logic gate in NMOS technology is a network of pull-down transistors and a single pull-up. The pull-up will be a depletion mode device, and the gate will be connected to the logic gate's output. The depletion implant adjusts the transistor threshold to below zero volts, with the effects that such a pull-up transistor
</p>
<ul><li> is always on
</li><li> can pull all the way to the positive rail
</li><li> conducts better at a given voltage, for an improved rising edge.
</li></ul>
<p>These pull-ups account for the higher power consumption of NMOS compared to the later CMOS technology.
</p><p>Our problem in reverse-engineering NMOS chips is that the implant cannot be seen in our photographs.  (There may be staining techniques which will help but we haven't yet tried them.)
</p><p>So, having identified all the transistors on a chip such as the 6502, we have to engage in some deduction and guesswork to infer which transistors are depletion mode.
</p><p>First, the easy cases:
</p>
<ul><li> all pull-downs are enhancement mode
</li><li> all pass gates are enhancement mode
</li><li> all transistors with gate connected to source are depletion mode
</li></ul>
<p>Next, there are three cases we can be fairly sure of
</p>
<ul><li> clock drivers must have depletion mode pullups because they need logic 1 to reach the rail 
</li><li> the huge pull-ups at the output pads will be enhancement mode, which means a logic 0 will pull down to ground, and a logic 1 will be a volt or so less than the positive rail.
</li><li> a conventional super buffer circuit with a single pullup driven by the inverse of the single pulldown will have a depletion mode pullup
</li></ul>
<p>Here are some cases found on the 6502 which require some judgement and explanation:
</p>
<ul><li> t481, t1169, t1344, t1035 (all in the clock generation)
</li><li> t2544, t11  (inverse of phi1, used to pull down some of the datapath control signals)
</li><li> t1477 (timing generator)
</li><li> Datapath control line drivers (t1527, t439, ..., t2326)
</li><li> t2066 the tristate driver
</li><li> t367, the driver for RDY.
</li><li> t397 SYNC, t2208/t441 R/#W, t578/t3122 D1, and probably all the other first stage pin drivers.
</li><li> t2523, t76, t2179, t362 in the clock again, but second stage drivers this time.  Huge huge pulldowns.
</li><li> t1322, the dead PLA line.
</li></ul>
<p>(All of these are depletion on the Rockwell and Atari 6507+6532 schematics; could not verify SYNC and R/#W and the external clock outputs on those).
</p><p>(Need to convert the above into links: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071325/http://visual6502.org/JSSim/expert.html?nosim=t&amp;find=t3353" class="external text" rel="nofollow">t3353</a> ADL bus precharge
</p><p>The precharges for all four internal busses are enhancement mode.
