<title>6502 BRK and B bit - VisualChips</title>
</head>
<body>
		<!-- start content -->
<p>The 6502 has 4 sources of interrupt-like behaviour: BRK, RESET, IRQ and NMI.
</p><p>Much has been said about these - it's common to find confusion about the behaviour of the B bit in the pushed status word - and we can say a little more, with reference to our in-browser simulation of the NMOS 6502.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="the_B_flag_and_the_various_mechanisms"> the B flag and the various mechanisms </span></h2>
<p>First technical point: the B flag position in the status register is not a bit in the status register: it is unaffected by PLP and RTI. However, the 6502 does push the register with either a 1 or 0. The intention is to distinguish a BRK from an IRQ, which is needed because these two share the same vector.  Brad Taylor says:
</p>
<ul><li> software instructions BRK &amp; PHP will push the B flag as being 1. 
</li><li> hardware interrupts IRQ &amp; NMI will push the B flag as being 0. 
</li></ul>
<p>As it happens, there are bugs such that this description isn't strictly true in all situations, and the root cause is that the machinery for
</p>
<ul><li> recording a pending hardware interrupt  (using a control signal called D1x1)
</li><li> forcing zero into the IR so the PLA performs the interrupt actions (uses D1x1, but at a different time to saving B)
</li><li> saving a value in the B position (distinguishing BRK/PHP from a pending hardware interrupt)
</li><li> forcing the appropriate values on the address bus to fetch the vector destination
</li></ul>
<p>are separate and independent.
</p><p>(Note that the visual6502 sim reports the P register as if B was a storage element: in fact it is observing the node which conditionally drives the data bus during a push of P. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071302/http://visual6502.org/JSSim/expert.html?nosim=t&amp;find=p4&amp;panx=431.8&amp;pany=310.8&amp;zoom=10.7" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here.</a>
This node is the output of an inverter and is a doubly-inverted D1x1.)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="IRQ_preceding_a_BRK_instruction"> IRQ preceding a BRK instruction </span></h2>
<p>(D1x1 was named by Balazs Beregnyei in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071302/http://www.downloads.reactivemicro.com/Public/Electronics/CPU/6502%20Schematic.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">giant schematic</a>.  By all means refer to the schematic but note that it is a description of Rockwell's version of the 6502)
</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071302/http://visual6502.org/JSSim/expert.html?graphics=f&amp;a=0&amp;d=58eaeaea&amp;irq0=5&amp;irq1=6&amp;steps=36&amp;loglevel=3&amp;logmore=irq,D1x1,DPControl" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Here's an URL</a> which uses CLI and sets off a very short IRQ pulse.
</p><p>You'll see that the D1x1 signal latches the pending interrupt, causes the pushed B to be zero, and is then cleared during the vector pull. This same signal is gated by 'Fetch' to produce 'ClearIR' (which jams zero into the IR)
</p><p>Note also that the address pushed is for the instruction after the BRK. The BRK has masked the IRQ, because the IRQ handler will inspect the saved P and process the BRK.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="late_NMI_will_not_half-modify_vector_reads"> late NMI will not half-modify vector reads </span></h2>
<p>This is a (necessary) feature: if an NMI occurs during the read of high and low vectors, it must not modify only the second read: modifying neither or both will determine whether the interrupt acts like an NMI or like the BRK/IRQ which is in progress.
</p><p>We note it here because we can point out the mechanism: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071302/http://visual6502.org/JSSim/expert.html?nosim=t&amp;find=t970&amp;panx=52.2&amp;pany=123.3&amp;zoom=12.4" class="external text" rel="nofollow">transistor t970</a>, where the logic is:
</p>
<pre> 1368&nbsp;:= NMIP and not NMIL and not &lt;VEC&gt;.phi2
 NMIG&nbsp;:= &lt;1368&gt;.phi1 or (&lt;NMIG&gt;.phi2 and not &lt;brk-done&gt;.phi1)
</pre>
<p>(Note that not all these signal names are presently known to the visual6502 netlist. Will be fixed.)

</li></ul>
<p>Because the B bit is stored as a 1, even though the NMI vector has been followed, in this case, the NMI handler could inspect the saved P register, in case a BRK was interrupted. It would then have to adjust the saved PC. This all takes time, and yet NMI is usually for rapid interrupt servicing.
</p><p>As the NMI handler would not normally inspect P, this is a case of NMI masking BRK. If BRK is an OS call, it would not be made, and so you can't do that on a system using NMI.
