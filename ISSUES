This is a list of remaining issues noticed after "mkmd" was partially working.

Problems that are understood and may affect all pages:

#001 Directly-linked thumbnails are treated as images. In most cases there are
no larger images so this turns out to be fine. In a few cases there are thumbs
so the larger image is currently not reachable. Page index.php-title-RCA_1802E
is affected. This is relate to #003.

#005 Broken external links to external pages. These could be fixed by pointing
them at the Wayback Machine equivalents; this process could be automated.

#007 List numbering is handled at runtime by a script in MediaWiki sites (and
it doesn't alwas work right; see the double numbering in the nested list on
the index.php-title-RCA_1802E page). Currently, I'm rendering all the lists
as unnumbered lists, which helps with the broken list in RCA_1802E but may
be a bad answer for other lists in the wiki.

Page: ./tools/mkmd -o ./wiki -m work/wiki/index.php-title-Special-AllPages

#002 There is a tiny bogus table near that top of the page, below the words
"From VisualChips" and before the main table.

Page: ./tools/mkmd -o ./wiki -m work/wiki/index.php-title-RCA_1802E

#003 Below the small heading Datapath, there is markdown for a link to the
page http://visual6502.org/wiki/images/6/62/1802_dpth.png visible in the page.
There was a similar issue for the "Control Logic" heading above that, but it
was fixed; this one can be fixed easily in the same way. But the easy fix is
also the cause of issue #001.

#004 In the paragraphs headed "Simple Logic Gates" and "NOR4 Layout" toward
the bottom of the page, there are broken image links.

#006 Nested lists are currently flattened into a single list. Depending on
the markdown layout engine, this may be fixable; it should be fixable on
Github Pages.
