#005 Broken links to external pages. These could be fixed by pointing them
at the Wayback Machine equivalents. This process could be automated by
probing the external URL at build time and probing the Wayback Machine
for a link if the original link 404s. (DEFERRED)

#006 All lists are currently bulleted (unordered) lists. Nested lists are
currently flattened into the first level list. (DEFERRED)

#011 Many anchor links don't work correctly. Cause is handling of special
characters in the conversion of the link. This is messy to fix.

#012 The "image" pages that are actually HTML are mostly linked and working
now, but they don't contain the link to the actual image because I suppress
the DIV that contains it--this was part of an earlier fix to the "image links
inside A tags" issue(s).

#013 Image links with %NN escapes in the query string are not being made into
safe URLs correctly. This is different from #011. The likely cause is ref to
u.RawQuery in safe URL code--it probably needs to ref the decoded query.

#014 Review the "functional" pages, like "Recent Changes". I didn't download
most of these, but some of them are linked (broken links) from the main page.

#015 Figure out what to put in each page for header and footer information.
Something about the history in the header. Something about the licensing and
authorship in the footer.

#016 Figure out what to put on the two README pages to enable visitors to
find the content.

Issues that are fixed or not worth fixing

#001 (FIXED?) Directly-linked thumbnails are treated as images. In most cases there
are no larger images so this turns out to be fine. In a few cases there are thumbs
so the larger image is currently not reachable. Page index.php-title-RCA_1802E
is affected. This is relate to #003, #008, and #009. More thought it needed.

#008 (NON-ISSUE? DEFERRED) The following images contain "!" characters in
their paths. URLs linking to these images have the "!" escaped as %21. The
"!" is an aggressive Shell metacharacter, which may or may not be an issue.
See also #009. (Note: since this may be a non-issue, I removed the list of
files; the command to regenerate is: find wiki/images | grep '[0-9]\!'

#009 (NON-ISSUE? DEFERRED) URL paths are not fixed to URL-safe even though
the file names are. This may be the cause of #004 the broken image link in
the RCA 1802 page (FALSE, #004 IS FIXED.)

#010 FIXED It looks like internal image links are not being passed through
the urlSafeUrl() function the way internal page links are. Need to check this.

Page: ./tools/mkmd -o ./wiki -m work/wiki/index.php-title-Special-AllPages:

#002 FIXED There is a tiny bogus table near that top of the page, below the words
"From VisualChips" and before the main table.

Page: ./tools/mkmd -o ./wiki -m work/wiki/index.php-title-RCA_1802E

#003 FIXED Below the small heading Datapath, there is markdown for a link to the
page http://visual6502.org/wiki/images/6/62/1802_dpth.png visible in the page.
There was a similar issue for the "Control Logic" heading above that, but it
was fixed; this one can be fixed easily in the same way. But the easy fix is
also the cause of issue #001.

#004 FIXED In the paragraphs headed "Simple Logic Gates" and "NOR4 Layout" toward
the bottom of the page, there are broken image links. This may be a consequence
of #008/#009.

#007 Consolidated into #006: List numbering is handled at runtime by a script
in MediaWiki sites (and it doesn't alwas work right; see the double numbering
in the nested list on the index.php-title-RCA_1802E page). Currently, I'm
rendering all the lists as unnumbered lists, which helps with the broken list
in RCA_1802E but may be a bad answer for other lists in the wiki.
