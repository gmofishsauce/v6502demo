This is a list of remaining issues noticed after "mkmd" was partially working.

Problems that are understood and may affect all pages:

#001 (FIXED?) Directly-linked thumbnails are treated as images. In most cases there are
no larger images so this turns out to be fine. In a few cases there are thumbs
so the larger image is currently not reachable. Page index.php-title-RCA_1802E
is affected. This is relate to #003, #008, and #009. More thought it needed.

#005 Broken external links to external pages. These could be fixed by pointing
them at the Wayback Machine equivalents; this process could be automated.

#007 List numbering is handled at runtime by a script in MediaWiki sites (and
it doesn't alwas work right; see the double numbering in the nested list on
the index.php-title-RCA_1802E page). Currently, I'm rendering all the lists
as unnumbered lists, which helps with the broken list in RCA_1802E but may
be a bad answer for other lists in the wiki.

#008 (NON-ISSUE? DEFERRED) The following images contain "!" characters in
their paths. URLs linking to these images have the "!" escaped as %21. The
"!" is an aggressive Shell metacharacter, which may or may not be an issue.
See also #009. (Note: since this may be a non-issue, I removed the list of
files; the command to regenerate is: find wiki/images | grep '[0-9]\!'

#009 (NON-ISSUE? DEFERRED) URL paths are not fixed to URL-safe even though
the file names are. This may be the cause of #004 the broken image link in
the RCA 1802 page (FALSE, #004 IS FIXED.)

#010 It looks like internal image links are not being passed through the
urlSafeUrl() function the way internal page links are. Need to check this.

#011 Many anchor links don't work correctly. Cause is handling of special
characters in the conversion of the link.

Problems that specific to certain pages

Page: ./tools/mkmd -o ./wiki -m work/wiki/index.php-title-Special-AllPages

#002 There is a tiny bogus table near that top of the page, below the words
"From VisualChips" and before the main table.

Page: ./tools/mkmd -o ./wiki -m work/wiki/index.php-title-RCA_1802E

#003 FIXED Below the small heading Datapath, there is markdown for a link to the
page http://visual6502.org/wiki/images/6/62/1802_dpth.png visible in the page.
There was a similar issue for the "Control Logic" heading above that, but it
was fixed; this one can be fixed easily in the same way. But the easy fix is
also the cause of issue #001.

#004 FIXED In the paragraphs headed "Simple Logic Gates" and "NOR4 Layout" toward
the bottom of the page, there are broken image links. This may be a consequence
of #008/#009.

#006 Nested lists are currently flattened into a single list. Depending on
the markdown layout engine, this may be fixable; it should be fixable on
Github Pages.
