#### Welcome to the **recovered** [`visual6502.org`](http://visual6502.org) Wiki!

You can browse the wiki's [main page](./wiki/index.php-title-Main_Page),
which contains a link to the index of all pages.

Links back to the top-level [`visual6502.org`](http://visual6502.org) site are retained,
and most still work. My recovery effort is focused on the site's wiki,
which [has not been available](http://visual6502.org/wiki) for several years..

My goal was _content recovery_. I downloaded the entire wiki and translated it
to a more modern form, markdown. The recovered site is not a wiki; my intent was
to make the historical content available. My process, intermediate steps, and
code are [open source](https://github.com/gmofishsauce/v6502demo).
