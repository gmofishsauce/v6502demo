The classic and best 6502 block diagram is taken from Donald F. Hanson's paper "A VHDL Conversion Tool for Logic Equations with Embedded D Latches" ([http://www.ncsu.edu/wcae/WCAE1/hanson.pdf](http://www.ncsu.edu/wcae/WCAE1/hanson.pdf)), which was presumably presented at Workshops on Computer Architecture Education at HPCA 1, January 1995

"A block diagram for the 6502 microprocessor is shown in Figure 3. This was drawn to correspond to the blueprint."
