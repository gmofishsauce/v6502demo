## Template talk:Note

#### From VisualChips

The slightly defective footnote solution consists of three template pages: Template:Ref, Template:Note and Template:Footnote

The definitions originate from wikipedia: see [here](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Footnotes#Yet_another_solution:_.22ref.22_and_.22endnote.22_templates) but have been cut down because #if didn't seem to work in this wiki.
