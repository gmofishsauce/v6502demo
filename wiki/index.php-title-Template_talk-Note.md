The slightly defective footnote solution consists of three template pages: Template:Ref, Template:Note and Template:Footnote


The definitions originate from wikipedia: see 
[here](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Footnotes#Yet_another_solution:_.22ref.22_and_.22endnote.22_templates) but have been cut down because 
#if
 didn't seem to work in this wiki.
