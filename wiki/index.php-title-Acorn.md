Acorn's computers used a variety of Ferranti ULAs, none of which have yet been reverse engineered although high-level models do exist in the form of machine-level emulators.


-  Acorn BBC Micro Video ULA

-  Acorn BBC Micro Tube ULA

-  A 9-tile array. Mark Haysman has donated a part marked Ferranti ULA9C018E-7 8504, which has kindly been depackaged by 3gforensics.  We do not yet have photographs of the die.

  Acorn Electron ULA

-  A 12-tile array in a lidded ceramic package (probably labelled 12C021M).  Theo Markettos and Sergei Skorobogatov have photographed the die and C.S. has stitched the images and produced a corrected monochrome image of the metallisation layer. No images released yet, no netlist extracted yet.
