Who am I?


In the UK, working in and around Bristol in the semiconductor industry for 25 years or so.


Fell in love with computers at an early age, soldered up a kit computer while at school. Got interested in machine code programming, specifically with 6502 - I don't think anyone forgets their first CPU.  Was generally more interested in maths and programming than games, but have got obsessively involved with games once or twice: Battlezone and Asteroids being notable examples.  Most recently became obsessively involved with visual6502 and related reverse engineering of chips.


-  Number of computers in reaching distance: 6

-  Number of those based on 6502: 4

-  Most-visited websites: 6502.org, lwn.net
