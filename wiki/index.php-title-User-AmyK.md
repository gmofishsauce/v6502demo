I am a programmer and hardware/software researcher (mostly software.) I'm familiar with both PC architecture as well as a number of embedded processors like Z80, 6502, 68HC12, etc.

My hardware projects include analysis of [s1mp3](http://wiki.s1mp3.org/Hardware), a cheap Z80-based portable media player platform. You can see more information about my work on this [here](http://wiki.s1mp3.org/User:Amyk).

[Here](http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/212/1802ctl.png) is a tentative schematic of the [RCA\_1802E](index.php-title-RCA_1802E.md) control unit.
