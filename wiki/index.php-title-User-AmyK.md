I am a programmer and hardware/software researcher (mostly software.) I'm familiar with both PC architecture as well as a number of embedded processors like Z80, 6502, 68HC12, etc.


My hardware projects include analysis of 
[s1mp3](http://wiki.s1mp3.org/Hardware), a cheap Z80-based portable media player platform. You can see more information about my work on this 
[here](http://wiki.s1mp3.org/User:Amyk).


[Here](http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/212/1802ctl.png) is a tentative schematic of the 
[RCA\_1802E](index.php?title=RCA_1802E) control unit.
