Welcome to the visualchips wiki.  Please see also [the visual6502.org site](http://visual6502.org) which contains the backstory, useful links, a FAQ, and a link to [the project blog](http://blog.visual6502.org/).

We're all about reverse-engineering popular chips from the 70's and 80's - initially the 6502 but others too. This wiki is for documenting our findings and recording our sources, and is of course a work in progress.
