### Overview

To help explain which state each of our projects is at, here's a description of the steps we follow:

- Get a chip, usually just one of a particular kind but sometimes more
- Depackage the chip
- Chips with a metal lid or a ceramic sandwich [package](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package) are preferable since these have no plastic in contact with the die.
- Chips packaged in plastic must be treated with very hot, very nasty acids which we do at a local laboratory with proper equipment
- Photograph the exposed surface of the chip through a microscope
- Many separate photographs must be taken to cover the surface at high enough resolution
- Stitch the photographs into a single large image
- Alignment data is used to correct individual photographs for optical distortions
- Usually, de-layer the chip to reveal hidden or obscured lower features
- Photograph and stitch each layer image
- Align all layer images to each other
- Create polygon models of each part of the chip based on the aligned images
- Convert the polygon data into a description we can simulate
- Investigate the behaviour of the chip by simulation
- Investigate the layout and logic design
- Write up our results on this wiki

### Microphotography

Based on our own work and advice from several professionals in the field

- A 20x objective is great, while 100x is overkill and difficult to work with
- 10x is sometimes adequate for chips with 4 um to 6 um feature sizes, but its better to shoot at higher magnification and downsample the result.
- Useful whole-chip images are typically 6000 to 10000 pixels on a side
- Use an X-Y table to ensure no rotation between the successive images
- A position readout is not needed, and position information from the microscope is not used to stitch images
- Try to get the chip dead level so its entire surface is in the focal plane
- A tip-tilt stage with micrometer drive is essential for this, unless you are very patient
- Use a manual fixed exposure, zoom, and white balance for all images
- Microscopes with a variable zoom are not helpful and could waste a lot of your time later on
- Save images in RAW format if possible at the highest quality
- Aim for at least 200 pixels of overlap between adjacent images

### De-layering

Stripping away individual layers of a chip to reveal the parts and features below can be one of the most difficult and even hazardous procedures owing to the chemicals involved and their byproducts.

- Some labs may use repeated mechanical or chemical-mechanical polishing and photography to image successive layers
- This is more common for modern devices, especially those that have been planarized during manufacture
- It may be riskier and costlier for the older chips we study which have only a single metal layer and whos surfaces are very irregular
- Plasma etching and various chemicals can be used to remove all the material of a particular layer at once
