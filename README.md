## Welcome to the v6502 Wiki Recovery Demo

The directory 2023-09 contains the second effort at rescuing this site. The rest of this short note is about the other files, which come from the first investigation (late 2021).

This is a demo of a possible markdown-based recovery of the Visual6502.org wiki.  Changes committed to this repository
will be processed through the Jekyll static site generator and published a few minutes later at https://gmofishsauce.github.io/v6502demo/
